## Theory

In this program, we studied the concept of **List in Python**.  
A list is a collection of items stored in a single variable. Lists are written using
square brackets `[ ]`.

Lists have the following features:
- Lists are **ordered**
- Lists are **changeable (mutable)**
- Lists **allow duplicate values**
- Lists can store **different data types** like integers, floats, strings, and boolean values

Through this program, we learned how to create lists, access elements, modify values,
add and remove elements, and perform operations on numeric data such as marks and grocery items.

## Algorithm

### Algorithm 1: Marks Analysis using List

1. Start  
2. Create a list named `marks` containing student marks  
3. Find maximum marks using `max()`  
4. Find minimum marks using `min()`  
5. Find total marks using `sum()`  
6. Find number of elements using `len()`  
7. Calculate average marks  
8. Sort the marks in ascending order  
9. Display the results  
10. Stop

### Algorithm 2: Grocery List Operations

1. Start  
2. Create a list named `grocery` containing grocery items  
3. Add a new item using `append()`  
4. Remove items using `remove()`  
5. Display the updated grocery list  
6. Stop
